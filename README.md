# Public Transit Status with Apache Kafka

An around Apache kafka pipeline using public data from the [Chicago Transit Authority](https://www.transitchicago.com/data/)
to simulate and display the public status of train lines in real time.

## Prerequisites

The following are required to complete this project:

* Docker
* Python 3.7
* Access to a computer with a minimum of 16gb+ RAM and a 4-core CPU to execute the simulation


## Running and Testing

To run the simulation, you must first start up the Kafka ecosystem on their machine utilizing Docker Compose.

```%> docker-compose up```

Docker compose will take a 3-5 minutes to start, depending on your hardware. Please be patient and wait for the docker-compose logs to slow down or stop before beginning the simulation.

Once docker-compose is ready, the following services will be available:

| Service | Host URL | Docker URL | Username | Password |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public Transit Status | [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) | n/a | ||
| Landoop Kafka Connect UI | [http://localhost:8084](http://localhost:8084) | http://connect-ui:8084 |
| Landoop Kafka Topics UI | [http://localhost:8085](http://localhost:8085) | http://topics-ui:8085 |
| Landoop Schema Registry UI | [http://localhost:8086](http://localhost:8086) | http://schema-registry-ui:8086 |
| Kafka | PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092,PLAINTEXT://localhost:9093,PLAINTEXT://localhost:9094 | PLAINTEXT://kafka0:9092,PLAINTEXT://kafka1:9093,PLAINTEXT://kafka2:9094 |
| REST Proxy | [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082/) | http://rest-proxy:8082/ |
| Schema Registry | [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/ ) | http://schema-registry:8081/ |
| Kafka Connect | [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083) | http://kafka-connect:8083 |
| KSQL | [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088) | http://ksql:8088 |
| PostgreSQL | `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/cta` | `jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/cta` | `cta_admin` | `chicago` |

Note that to access these services from your own machine, you will always use the `Host URL` column.

### Running the Simulation

There are two pieces to the simulation, the `producer` and `consumer`. As you develop each piece of the code, it is recommended that you only run one piece of the project at a time.

#### To run the `producer`:

1. `cd producers`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python simulation.py`

Once the simulation is running, you may hit `Ctrl+C` at any time to exit.

#### To run the Faust Stream Processing Application:

1. `cd consumers`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `faust -A faust_stream worker -l info`


#### To run the KSQL Creation Script:

1. `cd consumers`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python ksql.py`

#### To run the `consumer`:

1. `cd consumers`
2. `virtualenv venv`
3. `. venv/bin/activate`
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `python server.py`

Once the server is running, you may hit `Ctrl+C` at any time to exit.
